### Hi, I'm José, a software engineer.

I was looking for follow-along materials for a session that was a couple months old at the time. I quickly discovered how difficult it was to locate follow-along information for a certain lesson when it wasn't a recent class. I realized that those attempting to catch-up would suffer the same difficulties, and I wanted to assist them. So I created this website since I enjoy building Sites and help others.

I had trouble locating the required readings and homework for earlier classes and assumed that if I was having trouble, others must be also having issues.

Therefore, I wanted to help others and make life simpler for everyone who might have missed the live classes of the last two cohorts.
