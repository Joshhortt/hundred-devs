### Hi, I'm José, a software engineer.

I was looking for follow-along materials for a session that was a couple months old at the time. I quickly discovered how difficult it was to locate follow-along information for a certain lesson when it wasn't a recent class. I realized that those attempting to catch up would suffer the same difficulties, and I wanted to assist them. So I created this website since I enjoy constructing things and assisting others.
