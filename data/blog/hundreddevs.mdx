## #100Devs - The Free 30 Week Software Engineering Bootcamp

**Author & Mentor:** [Leon Noel](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)

This article is dedicated to making it straightforward for the catch-up crew and newcomers to locate the follow-along materials, the homework, and the class files instead of sifting through all of the more recent Discord messages.

If you're not in the discord: you should join!

Please be aware that 100Devs and Leon Noel are not endorsing, sponsoring, or affiliated with me.

I had trouble locating the required readings and homework for earlier classes and assumed that if I was having trouble, others must be.

I, therefore, wanted to assist others and make life simpler for everyone who might have missed the live classes.

### Main Resources

The following Roadmap is also beneficial and geared toward making it simple for the "Catch-up-Crew" to locate the [follow-along materials](https://100devsfollowalong.netlify.app/index.html), the homework, and the class files without having to sift through all of the more recent discord messages.

**Deep Dive into code**

Please take tonight to work with others and comment every line of this of this [Todo List](https://github.com/100devs/todo-list-express)
Work together to understand each line and support folx when things don't make sense right away!

We'll be building this todo list live during Thursdays class, but I want everyone to have the chance to work through the code before then.
Also, I'll ask you to submit your commented code on Thursday.
I'll pick one person who submits and complete the first half of their HITLIST for them live during a future class! I'll find the jobs,
write the intro messages, and get your HUNT started RIGHT!

If you want a sneak peak, you should check out [@Mayanwolfe](https://twitter.com/mayanwolfe) 6+ hour stream walking through the [todolist](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1544735467) as it will get you super prepared.
