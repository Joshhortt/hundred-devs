**Deep Dive into code**

> Please take tonight to work with others and comment every line of this of this [Todo List](https://github.com/100devs/todo-list-express) <br /> Work together to understand each line & support folx when things don't make sense right away! <br /> We'll be building this todo list live during Thursdays class, but I want everyone to have the chance to work through the code before then. <br /> Also, I'll ask you to submit your commented code on Thursday. <br /> I'll pick one person who submits and complete the first half of their HITLIST for them live during a future class! I'll find the jobs, write the intro messages, and get your HUNT started RIGHT!
