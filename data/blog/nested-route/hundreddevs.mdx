## 100Devs - The Free 30 Week Software Engineering Bootcamp

**Author & Mentor:** [Leon Noel](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/)

This Website is dedicated to making it straightforward for the catch-up crew and newcomers to locate the follow-along materials, the homework, and the class files.

Please be aware that **100devs** and **Leon Noel** are not endorsing, sponsoring, or affiliated with me.

I had trouble locating the required readings and homework for earlier classes and assumed that if I was having trouble, others must be also having issues.

Therefore, I wanted to assist others and make life simpler for everyone who might have missed the live classes of the last two cohorts.
